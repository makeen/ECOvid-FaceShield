# ECOvid Protective Face Sheild

A protective face shield fast to print and that use a minimum amount of material. 

This face shield is currently used in ICU MIR  at Hospital Cochin (APHP, Paris).  This design is validated by the Hygiene Committee of the hospital.

## Print Settings

The *.3mf* file is present on the repo.  Here are the important settings for the Ender 3 pro.  
- Fill gaps between walls: *Nowhere*
- Infill density 80%
- Print speed 80 mm/s
- Generate support: *No*
- Build plate adhesion Type: *Skirt*


## Fabrication

### Material
- A4 transparent sheet 
- Standard EU punch hole, 2 holes ([exemple](https://www.google.com/search?q=punch+hole+2&hl=en&sxsrf=ALeKk01VRlmL0uM0lpgbsiWLHW1cRw-DiQ:1585672351383&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjr1-_pkcXoAhXU8OAKHVQoCY4Q_AUoAXoECAsQAw))
- 3d printed 

### Steps
- 3D print the face shield 
- Punch two holes on one side of the transparent shield, flip it over and punch two more holes from the other side. 
- Attach the transparent sheet
- Sterilize



## Edit the model

The source (*.blend*) is included. It is composed of three separate parts, **External**, **Internal** and **Strap**. I rely on non-destructive modelling techniques and used a lot of boolean operations.

To adjust the height of the stack, select each part and edit the value *count* of the *Array* modifier. 

To export the model, select the 3 parts and click *Export* on the 3D-print panel.

The following add-ons were used: Measure-it, 3D-Print Toolbox,  Bool Tool, Curve Tools and Bezier Utilities. Freestyle for rendering.
